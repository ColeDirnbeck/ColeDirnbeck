Hi, Iâ€™m @ColeDirnbeck

I am a junior at Temple University studying for my B.S. in Computer Science (current graduation date: SPRING 2025). I received my Associate in Computer Science from LCCC (Lehigh Carbon Community College in Schnecksville, PA) in 2023. 
I have experience with C, C++, Python, and SQL. Additionally, I am learning and expanding my knowledge of those languages and plan to learn other languages in the immediate future.

Inside this repository, I have several projects that I completed in the last 2 years. The Python Projects are about stocks and data analysis, and the C++ project is a "Pig" dice game. Please check them out!

[PROJECTS]

Project 0 -- Pig Dice Game (C++)

Project 1 -- Technical Analysis of Stocks and creating Candlestick graphs on stocks (Python)

Project 2 -- Discounted Cash Flow Model (Python)

Project 3 -- Black Scholes Model (Python)

Thank you,

Cole Dirnbeck
